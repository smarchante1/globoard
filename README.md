# Globoard Product Plan

## How to Install

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__:  
-Integrating hardware and software utilizing a single-board microcontroller.  
-Building a mobile application using React-Native.  
-Creating UI components(or integrating UI component libraries).

1. __Problem Statement__:  
-Globoard will provide a visual element to playing guitar by creating a fully customizable light-up fretboard with a companion app.

1. __Market Research__:  
-__Fretlight__: Custom Electric and Acoustic guitars with LED's built into the fretboard.    
-__FretZealot__: LED tape strips that go under strings on top of the fretboard.  
    -These alternatives are primarily for learning purposes as they do not allow the user to customize light settings. They do not sense and track hand movements. Most importantly, these options require you to purchase the expensive required equipment.  
    -Globoard is not a light-based learning system. It's a visual component to playing guitar that enhances user experience and accesibility. You don't have to just hear the music to enjoy it.  
    
  
1. __User Personas__:   
-Globoard's main user is a guitarist that wants to fully customize an awesome visual experience to their playing. They care about style and they care about look of thier instrument, not just the sound. This musician wants to give dynamic performances and also wants music to be an accessible experience to everyone (those with hearing difficulties).
